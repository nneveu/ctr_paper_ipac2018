\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present electron bunch length measurements 
at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) photoinjector facility. 
The AWA accelerator has a large dynamic charge density range, 
with electron beam charge varying between 0.1 nC - 100 nC, 
and laser spot size diameter at the cathode between 0.1 mm - 18 mm. 
The bunch length measurements were taken at different charge densities 
using a metallic screen and a Martin-Puplett interferometer to perform 
autocorrelation scans of the corresponding coherent transition radiation (CTR). 
A liquid helium-cooled 4K bolometer was used to register the interferometer signal. 
The experimental results are compared with Impact-T and OPAL-T numerical simulations.
\end{abstract}


\section{AWA Facility}
The AWA Facility houses two rf photoinjectors, both 
operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. The photoinjector used for 
these studies consists of a gun and solenoids followed
by six accelerating cavities, as shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}. 
This beam line is capable of low (\SI{0.1}{nC}) and 
high charge (\SI{100}{nC}) operation. The bunch charge is 
routinely adjusted for depending on the requirements 
of the experiments downstream of the photoinjector.
Typical operating charges are 1, 4, 10, and \SI{40}{nC}. 
While these are the most
common operating modes, other charges have been requested 
and provided depending on the experiment.
Recent experiments include emittance exchange \cite{eex}, 
structure tests \cite{pets}, thermal emittance measurements \cite{therm}, 
and two beam acceleration \cite{tba}. 


\section{CTR Measurement Technique}
CTR ref goes here~\cite{ctr}

\section{Simulations}
Simulations of the AWA beam line shown in Fig~\ref{beamline}
were performed in the PIC codes IMPACT~\cite{impact} and OPAL~\cite{opal}.
The gun, accelerating cavities, and solenoids were modeled with 2D
Poisson/Superfish~\cite{fish} files. All field maps were in the T7 format.
Input parameters for the simulations are shown in Table~\ref{simparam}.
Note that on crest refers to the phase of max energy gain.
In the case of the gun, a -~$20^{\circ}$ phase is measured 
w.r.t the phase of max energy gain. 
In other words, we ran $-20^{\circ}$ off crest.

Two scenario were simulated, a low charge case at \SI{1}{nC}, and a 
high charge case at \SI{40}{nC}.

\section{Experimental Setup}
The beam line layout is shown in Fig.~\ref{beamline}. 
Bunches were allowed to propagate freely to the 
CTR screen. The only focusing elements used were solenoids $S_1$ and
$S_2$. As the bunches passed the CTR screen, light was
emitted through a window located next to the screen, 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{inter}. A slit was used to prevent
background x-rays from reaching the bolometer.
After passing the slit, the light was captured 
using an interferometer outside the beam line, 
also shown in Fig~\ref{inter}. 
A remotely movable leg inside the interferometer was swept, 
and the resulting signal fed to the bolometer, 
which is shown in Fig.~\ref{bolo}. The bolometer 
was cooled with liquid helium. Period refilling of
the helium was required throughout the day in order
to keep the bolometer at \SI{4}{K}.

\section{jacow notes...}
Figure captions are placed below figures, and table
captions are placed above tables.

Figure captions are formatted as shown in Figs.~\ref{l2ea4-f1} and \ref{l2ea4-f2},
while table captions take the form of a heading,
with initial letters of principle words, capitalized, and
without a period at the end (see Tables~\ref{eq:units} and \ref{style-tab}).
Any reference to the contents of the table should be made from
the body of the paper rather than from within the table
caption itself.

 Single-line captions are centered in the column, while captions
that span more than one line should be justified.
The \LaTeX\ template uses the ‘booktabs’ package to
format tables.

If a displayed equation needs a number (i.\,e., it will be
referenced), place it it in parentheses, and flush with the
right margin of the column. The equation itself should be
indented and centered, as far as is possible:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:units}
    C_B=\frac{q^3}{3\epsilon_{0} mc}=\SI{3.54}{\micro eV/T}
\end{equation}

When referencing a numbered equation, the equation number is placed
in parentheses [e.g., Eq. (1)].

\section{checklist for electronic publication}

\begin{Itemize}
	\item  Use only Times or Times New Roman (standard, bold or italic) and Symbol
	fonts for text---\SI{10}{pt} minimum except references, which can be \SI{9}{pt} or \SI{10}{pt}.
	\item  Figures should use Times or Times New Roman (standard, bold or italic) and
	Symbol fonts when possible---\SI{6}{pt} minimum.
	\item  Check that citations to references appear in sequential order and
	that all references are cited.
	\item  Check that the PDF file prints correctly.
	\item  Check that there are no page numbers.
	\item  Check that the margins on the printed version are within \SI{\pm1}{mm}
	of the specifications.
	\item  \LaTeX\ users can check their margins by invoking the
	\texttt{boxit} option.
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsection{Author Listing} Careful attention should be given to the
placing of commas and the use of ‘and’ in the author list.
In particular, for the case of six or more authors
(Ref. [3]), a comma also follows the penultimate author.
The preference for ‘\emph{et al.}’\ takes precedence when the number
of authors becomes large (e.g., $>$6).

\subsection{Alignment of References}

In the \LaTeX\ template, \verb|\bibliography{9}| is used for
when the total number of references is less than ten. This
should be changed to \verb|\bibliography{99}| if the number of
references is ten or more.
