%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility
houses two rf photoinjectors operating at \SI{1.3}{GHz}. 
The \SI{70}{MeV} beam line consists of an rf gun with a 
$\text{Cs}_2\text{Te}$ cathode, followed by six normal conducting linac cavities, 
and four quadrupoles. Follwing the quads, a kicker and septum will be installed
in the near future.
